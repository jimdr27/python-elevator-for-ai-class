Elevator Search Problem â€” AI Search Algorithms

This project implements AI search algorithms (DFS, BFS, and a Heuristic Search) to solve an elevator transportation problem.
The goal is to simulate how an elevator can transport people from four different floors to the roof using different search strategies.
